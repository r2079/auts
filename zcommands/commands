Some frequent commands that i frequently forget ;) 

# To replace a word via sed 
sed s/from/for/g <filname> will replace the word from with for

#Esxi 

1. List the inventory ID of the virtual machine with the command:

#GIT 

$ git config credential.helper store

#Editing timezones


Use timedatectl

sudo timedatectl set-timezone <timeszone>

The best part - it's not interactive as dpkg-reconfigure tzdata

set timezone as EST:

sudo timedatectl set-timezone EST

set timezone as UTC:

sudo timedatectl set-timezone UTC

list all timezones:

timedatectl list-timezones
sudo dpkg-reconfigure tzdata

#Adding wget on mac 

brew install wget --with-libressl


# Mac Air was refusing SSH, did this to enable 

sudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ssh.plist

(Supply your password when it is requested) and then

Code:

sudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/ssh.plist


#Rsync 

-> To do successful rsync -> first you need to have seam-less ssh access -> ssh-copy-id will help there 
-> rsync -azP <remote> <local> will copy all the files from remote to local 
-> rsync -azP <local> <remote> will copy all files from local to remote 

Idea is to have a cron running to do the checksum, if differs start a rsync from pictures folder to our Media serve


#To replace a text in all files with another using sed 
-> sed -i 's/omxplayer/omxplayer -o local/g' *.py
